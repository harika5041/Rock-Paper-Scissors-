This is a simple yet engaging Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows you to challenge the computer in a classic duel of choices. With an intuitive interface, players can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer will randomly select its own choice. The game then displays both choices and announces the winner based on the traditional rules:

- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
